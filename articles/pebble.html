    <h1>Title: Pebble is a Brat</h1>
    <p>Pebble is definitely a brat.</p>
    <p>She likes to hit her sister and also eat all her owner's earplugs. They don't very much appreciate
        it.
    </p>
    <p>They call her <abbr title="Pebble Boogins">PB</abbr>.</p>
    <p>Her sister, Nemi, had a few nice things to say about Pebble:</p>
    <blockquote>"She's really fast! And, and likes to play. And is super strong... and really fast!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>When asked to comment on her own roudy and petulant nature, Pebble responded, <q>F*** you, give me
            food.</q></p>
    <p>Though sometimes she is nice. She protects her owners while they poop.</p>
